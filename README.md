# Movie Hunt 🍿

Movie Hunt was created to help users find a movie they're interested in and just as quickly find out if & where that movie is streaming and/or where it can be rented.

Movie Hunt uses the TMDB (The Movie Data Base) API to request movie genres and also movie details that include their title, poster image, release date, description, streaming/renting providers, and trailer if TMDB has it available.

_This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB._

You can visit TMDB here: [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/ "The Movie Db's Homepage")

## Browse through Genres 🎥

If you're undecided on what movie to watch, browse through 19 different genres of movies to find one that matches the mood!

## Search for movie titles 🔎

If the Genres section doesn't have what you're looking for, try searching for key words directly within the Search section!

## View the site in Spanish! 🇲🇽

A toggle on the top-right of the site can be clicked/tapped to change the text and most of the content provided by the TMDB API to Spanish! The toggle has the 'EN' option on by default for English and you can switch to 'ES' for Spanish.
